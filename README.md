# Machine-Learning-for-Beginners-Updated-2-Submission

In submission section, the student must build a machine learning model for image classification and meet the submission criteria.

The criteria's are:

- Must be the **rock-paper-scissor** images as a dataset
- Must split the dataset into **train set** and **validation set** with ratio of **6 : 4**
- Must implement **Image Augmentation**
- Must use **Image Data Generator** technique
- A model must be built in **Sequential**
- Takes no more than **30 minutes** for the model to train
- The code must run in **Google Colaboratory**
- Accuracy is at a minimum of **85%**
- Must be able to **predict image** from the input in Google Colaboratory

Reviewers will give ratings by scaling from 1 - 5 based on the code when the task has met the criteria.

The details of the ratings are:

1. Indicated of plagiarism
2. The code needs to be fixed
3. Only to follow the modules provided in the course
4. Accuracy of the trained model is above **95%**
5. The accuracy is above **96%** and using **three or more** techniques that are not taught in the module.

The code in this repository is a result of my work
